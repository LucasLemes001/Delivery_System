1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Create a new branch
3. create a gitignore file, requiriments.txt file, and README
4. Create the new folders that we going to use:
    - css: coitaining the bootstrap
    - fonts: containing the fonts and icons configuration
    -js:: containing the javascript
    -img: containing the images of our project


Starting The Structure
====================

I've create a file called index.html. This file is the "main" file to the project. and out a html:5 structure.
inside the tag <head></head>:
    * Was used the <link> tag to link the css files, such as bootstrap, fonts and javascript and main.
inside the tag <body></body>:
    * Near to the and of the body's tag was opened two <scripts></scripts> tags.
        * One for the bootstrap.bundle.min.js
        * Another for our cardapio.min.js

With this, the first step for the structure is done.


Starting create the Homepage
==========================

Create a tag <div class="bg-top"> inside index.html

Inside the ./css/main.css:
    * Summon the Poppins Fonts using:
#         @font-face {
#     font-family: 'PoppinsMedium';
#     src: url('../fonts/Poppins-Medium.otf');
# }

# @font-face {
#     font-family: 'PoppinsRegular';
#     src: url('../fonts/Poppins-Regular.otf');
# }

    * Configure the Colors Variable we going to use in our project, Saving some time and space,
    for not doing all the configuration manually in each elements. Did just like this:
        # * :root {
        #     --color-name_as_you_wish: #colorcode;
        #     }

    * Configure the html and body's color and fonts-size:
        * Just like this:
            # html,body {
            #     background-color: var(color-the_name_I_gave_to_the_background_color);
            #     font-family: 'PoppinsRegular';'Rubok','sans-serif';     NOTE -> USE MORE THAN ONE, BEACUSE IF THE FONT INST FOUND IN ONE FILE, THAN THE SCRIPT WILL SEARCH IN ANOTHER ONE.
            #     font-size: 16px;
            #     color: var(color-the_name_I_gave_to_the_text_color);}
                
            
    * Create the same div class we've create inside index.html. (class="bg-top")
        * Add the configuration to then, just like this:
            <!-- - .bg-top {
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 0px;
                    left: 0px;
                    right: 0px;
                    height: 110px;
                    background-color: var(--color-secondary);
            } -->

    * Create one bord in "Index.html" that will be our base with:
        1. Pizza companny's name and logo.
        2. Some Information:
            * Open/Close
            * See more
        3. The board himself.
            
            To do this, we need to create some <header></header> tag, and name it with a class. (I name it "width-fix mt-5").
                Start the board cointainer with a <div class="card"></div>
                Because will cointain the companny's name, logo and information.

                    Inside this shit, we need to create another <div></div> tag, and name it with a class. (I name it "img-container") Beacuse will cointain the Companny's logo.

                    Another <div></div> tag, and name it with a class. (I name it "infos") Beacuse will cointain the Companny's information:
                        1. <h1><p> Companny's name</p></h1>

                        2. <div class="infos-sub></div>
                            Inside it, put the secondary information.
                                : Open/Close
                                    <p class="status open"><i class="fas fa-clock">  Open  </i></p>
                                : See more
                                    <a hrtf="#" class="see-more"> See more</a>

    This board could bee styled inside the css file. Inside "main.css" create the same header class name.]
    <!-- .width-fix {
        width: calc(100% - 20px);    # To always discard some space for scrolling
        margin: 0px auto;             # To center the board with the screen
    } -->

==============================
TIPS FOR WHAT HAPPEN UP HERE
==============================
 When you have a "card" or something similar, wich you cointain and Image, subtitle, links or something else
 in the same place, centered in the middle of the card, always separate thing in slices.

 =============================
        TIPS TO HTML/CSS
 ==============================
 Always create the tags classes, id or stuffs inside the main project  "index.html", and then
 style it inside the css file "main.css". 

 

=============
    Creating a Categories Menu's info
================

1. Inside the "index.html" starting the tags and classes <section></section>
    . I name the class "categoria width-fix mt-4" --> This means that will cointain the same width that has the  header board, and the same margin-top and padding.
2. On the "section" tag, it starts the sctructure of the menu's category with a "div" tag. I named "item-categoria btn btn-white btn-sm mb-3 me-03"
    . This means that this <div> can have 4 names inside and others configuration:
        1. The item-categoria
        2. btn
        3  btn-white
        4  btn-sm
        config: margin-bottom: 3px; margin-external: 3px;

    ====
    Check the main.css file to see exactly how to style the menu's category.
    =====

3. Inside the <div> upon, I put the differents type of categories inside, they are very similar, only a few changes can transfor their icon, color and stufs. check inside the main.css file: 
         ".item-categoria{}",
         ".btn{}"
         ".btn-white{}",
         ".btn-sm{}"
         ".btn-white:hover, btn-white.active{}"
